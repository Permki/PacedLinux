[UG_nfp6000_nfcc.pdf](https://github.com/Permki/PacedLinux/blob/main/Manuals/Firmware%20and%20FlowProcessor/UG_nfp6000_nfcc.pdf) Gives a very good and detailed spec of the Micro-C language as used on these cards. It also describes the use of memory and registers for the islands.\
This should be used as a reference manual for both syntax, _memory allocation_, _register model_ and _register regions_.
An overview of the architecture and scope of threads can also be found here.
