[6.1-migration.pdf](https://github.com/Permki/PacedLinux/blob/main/Manuals/UG_nfp6000_6.1-migration.pdf) is just an overview of added instructions\
[RM_nfp6000_microclib.pdf](https://github.com/Permki/PacedLinux/blob/main/Manuals/RM_nfp6000_microclib.pdf) contains a quite detailed specification and explanation of most basic functions used in the micro-c found on the NFP-cards. Mostly based on the C89/99 standard, but stripped down to micro and then supplemented with a couple of libraries needed for the NFP-cards.
